/**
 * The update gate's marker probe (R6, SPEC section 6 "Electron gate").
 *
 * A marker whose owner and delegate are dead is not necessarily a finished
 * update: an inheriting completion process can still hold the checkout's
 * kernel lock after the script's immediate child died. The Desktop cannot see
 * that lock portably and must never delete the marker (A7 rule 3), so a
 * dead/malformed marker is routed through the checkout script's `reclaim`
 * helper, which decides under the `<marker>.lock` sidecar:
 *
 * - `held` / `busy` / `live <pid>` => an update still owns the checkout: keep waiting;
 * - `reclaimed` / `absent` => nothing runs: proceed;
 * - `unsupported` (older checkout, no helper) => proceed without deleting
 *   (dead = not running, as before minus the deletion) — unless this process
 *   already saw the same body block: then the script is only missing or
 *   unreadable for a moment (git rewriting it mid-update), so the answer counts
 *   as `error` and is re-asked (review R8 M5).
 *
 * The helper is asked once per distinct dead marker body per wait; a `held` /
 * `busy` / `error` / `live` answer is re-asked every `reprobeMs` (5 s), or on
 * the next poll after a Retry, because only the script can see the lock being
 * released.
 *
 * No verdict has a ceiling (review R8 D3). `held` means no owner identity is
 * alive but some process still holds the checkout lock; it may be a leaked
 * long-lived one, and it may still be writing the install. `busy` / `error`
 * mean the helper could not establish ownership at all. None of them ever
 * opens the gate by itself: past a short grace the caller shows a blocked
 * boot screen (what holds the install, Retry, Quit) whose only way through
 * while the hold lasts is an explicit, confirmed, logged "Start anyway"
 * (`allowStartOverHold`), scoped to the exact marker body the user saw. The
 * marker is never touched. A helper `live <pid>` names a live identity and is
 * waited out like any live marker (C1 rule 3).
