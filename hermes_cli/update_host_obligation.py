"""Host-scoped update→restart obligation for ``hermes update``.

Multiplex-only (Teknium ruling): exactly ONE ``hermes gateway run`` per host serves every
profile, so "this pull still owes the fleet a restart" is a property of the HOST, not of one
profile's ``HERMES_HOME``. The legacy ``$HERMES_HOME/fleet_restart_pending`` marker was
per-home: ``hermes -p coder update`` armed and cleared coder's copy while restarting the
SHARED process, and every other profile's CLI could neither see nor discharge that obligation
— it simply armed its own and re-killed the same host process.

The record therefore lives beside the host rendezvous record, in
:func:`gateway.host_rendezvous.host_state_dir` (``$HERMES_GATEWAY_LOCK_DIR`` else
``$XDG_STATE_HOME/hermes/gateway-locks``) — the one cross-profile, per-OS-user state root the
tree already has. It is written once per host, read by every profile's CLI, and cleared once.

The same "one host process, not one per profile" identity is what
:func:`collapse_units_to_host_processes` applies to enumerated systemd units: leftover
per-profile ``hermes-gateway-<p>.service`` units on a multiplexed host all point at the same
live ``MainPID``, so restarting each one restarts the host process N times.
